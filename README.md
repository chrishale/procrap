# Procrap

A simple link blocker extension that redirects to a link of your choice (e.g. a strikeapp.com to do list). A pleasent reminder of all the things you still have to do.

## Instructions

1. After installing the plugin, click on the icon in Chrome's toolbar. 
2. Paste in the url you want to be redirected to in your moments of weakness.
3. GET STUFF DONE YO.

When you have finished, just remove the link from the extension and get your twitter fix.
